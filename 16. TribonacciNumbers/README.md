# ðŸŽ¯ Tribonacci Number Challenge

## Description
The **Tribonacci numbers** are a variation of the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the previous three terms instead of just two. The sequence is defined as follows:

$T_n = T_{n-1} + T_{n-2} + T_{n-3}$

With the initial values:
- $T_0 = 0$
- $T_1 = 1$
- $T_2 = 1$

The first Tribonacci numbers are: **0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, ...**

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 4  
Output: 4 (The fourth Tribonacci number is 4)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 6  
Output: 13 (The sixth Tribonacci number is 13)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a Java function to compute the **n-th Tribonacci number** using recursion.
2. Optimize the solution using **memoization** to improve efficiency.

## Constraints:
- The input number $n$ is a non-negative integer.
- Optimize for efficiency when possible.

Good luck! ðŸš€
