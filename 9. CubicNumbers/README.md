# ðŸŽ¯ Cubic Number as Sum of Consecutive Odd Numbers

## Description
This mathematical identity is commonly attributed to **Nicomachus of Gerasa**, a Greek mathematician from the 1st century AD. In his work *Introduction to Arithmetic*, he described patterns in square and cubic numbers, including the relationship between cubes and the sum of consecutive odd numbers.

### Identity:
The cube of a number \( n \) can be expressed as the sum of \( n \) consecutive odd numbers:

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Process: 2Â³ = 3 + 5
Output: true (8 = 3 + 5)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3
Process: 3Â³ = 7 + 9 + 11
Output: true (27 = 7 + 9 + 11)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a Java function to verify that the cube of a number equals the sum of the corresponding odd numbers.
2. Implement test cases for different values of \( n \).
3. (Optional) Find a way to generate the sequence of odd numbers efficiently.

## Historical Context
Nicomachus extensively studied number properties and was one of the first to formalize patterns in arithmetic. His observations on cubic numbers remain a fundamental insight in number theory.
