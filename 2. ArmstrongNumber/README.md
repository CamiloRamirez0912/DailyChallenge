# 🎯 Armstrong Number Challenge

## Description
An **Armstrong number** (also known as a **narcissistic number**) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 153  
Calculation: 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153  
Output: true (it is an Armstrong number)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: 9474  
Calculation: 9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴ = 9474  
Output: true (it is an Armstrong number)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a Java function to determine if a number is an Armstrong number.
2. Add test cases with different numbers.

## Constraints:
- The input number is a positive integer.
- Consider optimizing your solution for larger numbers.

Good luck! 🚀
