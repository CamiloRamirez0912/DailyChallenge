# ðŸŽ¯ Perfect Number Challenge

## Description
A **perfect number** is a number that is equal to the sum of its **proper divisors** (excluding itself).

### Example 1:
```
Input: 28  
Proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14  
Sum: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28  
Output: true (28 is a perfect number)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: 12  
Proper divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6  
Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16  
Output: false (12 is not a perfect number)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a Java function to determine if a number is perfect.
2. Add test cases with different numbers.

## Constraints:
- The input number is a positive integer.
- Optimize your solution for large numbers.

Good luck! ðŸš€
