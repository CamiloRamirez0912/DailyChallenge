# ðŸŽ¯ Automorphic Number Challenge

## Description
An **automorphic number** is a number whose square ends with the same digits as the number itself.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 25  
Process: 25Â² = 625  
Output: true (the square ends in 25)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: 7  
Process: 7Â² = 49  
Output: false (the square does not end in 7)
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: 76  
Process: 76Â² = 5776  
Output: true (the square ends in 76)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a Java function to determine if a number is automorphic.
2. Add test cases with different values.

## Constraints:
- The input number is a positive integer.
- Optimize your solution for large numbers.

Good luck! ðŸš€
