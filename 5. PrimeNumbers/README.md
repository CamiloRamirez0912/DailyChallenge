# ðŸŽ¯ Prime Number Challenge

## Description
A **prime number** is a number that has exactly two divisors: **1 and itself**. In other words, it cannot be evenly divided by any other number.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 7  
Output: true (7 is a prime number)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: 10  
Output: false (10 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 5)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a Java function to determine if a number is prime.
2. Add test cases with different numbers.
3. (Optional) Find all prime numbers within a given range (e.g., 1 to 1000).

## Constraints:
- The input number is a positive integer.
- Optimize your solution for large numbers.

Good luck! ðŸš€
