# ðŸŽ¯ Abundant Number Challenge

## Description
An **abundant number** is a number whose sum of proper divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number itself.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 12  
Proper Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6  
Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16  
16 > 12 â†’ true (12 is an abundant number)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: 15  
Proper Divisors: 1, 3, 5  
Sum: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9  
9 < 15 â†’ false (15 is not an abundant number)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a Java function to determine if a number is abundant.
2. Add test cases with different values.

## Constraints:
- The input number is a positive integer.
- Optimize your solution for large numbers.

Good luck! ðŸš€
