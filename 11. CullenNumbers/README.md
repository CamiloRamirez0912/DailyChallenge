# ðŸŽ¯ Cullen Number Challenge

## Description
A **Cullen number** is defined by the formula:

\[
C_n = n \times 2^n + 1
\]

Where \( n \) is a positive integer.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1  
Calculation: 1 Ã— 2^1 + 1 = 3  
Output: 3 (This is a Cullen number)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4  
Calculation: 4 Ã— 2^4 + 1 = 65  
Output: 65 (This is a Cullen number)
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 6  
Calculation: 6 Ã— 2^6 + 1 = 385  
Output: 385 (This is a Cullen number)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a Java function that takes an integer \( n \) and computes its Cullen number.
2. Add test cases for different values of \( n \).
3. (Optional) Find all Cullen numbers within a given range (e.g., \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 20 \)).

## Constraints:
- The input number \( n \) is a positive integer.
- Optimize your solution for larger values of \( n \).

Good luck! ðŸš€
