# ðŸŽ¯ Alternating Sum Challenge

## Description
Given a positive integer  $n$ , compute the sum of the first $n$ numbers while alternating their signs. The sequence is defined as:

$ S(n) = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + ... \pm n $

Where numbers in odd positions are added, and numbers in even positions are subtracted.

## Examples
### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5  
Output: 3  (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 = 3)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 10  
Output: -5  (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 + 9 - 10 = -5)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a **Java** function to compute this sum efficiently.
2. Implement both an **iterative version** and a **mathematical formula** if possible.
3. Add test cases for different values of $n$.

## Constraints:
- $n$ is a positive integer.
- The solution should be **efficient**, avoiding unnecessary loops where possible.

ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** Look for a pattern in the series to derive a direct formula.

Good luck! ðŸš€
