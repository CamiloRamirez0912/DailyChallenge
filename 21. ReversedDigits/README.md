# ðŸŽ¯ Reverse Digits Challenge

## Description
Given an integer $ n $, reverse its digits and return the resulting number. If $ n $ is negative, the sign must remain in the first position.

## Examples
### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 123  
Output: 321
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = -456  
Output: -654
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 1200  
Output: 21 (Leading zeros are removed)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a **Java** function that takes an integer and returns its reversed version.
2. Properly handle negative numbers.
3. Ensure that leading zeros are removed.
4. Implement test cases for different scenarios, including large and negative numbers.

## Constraints:
- Directly converting the number to a string and reversing it is **not allowed**.
- $n$ is an integer within the Java **int** range.
- Consider the possibility of integer overflow when reversing the number.

ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** Use mathematical operations like division and modulo to extract digits one by one.

Good luck! ðŸš€
