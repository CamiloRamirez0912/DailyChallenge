# ðŸŽ¯ Harshad Number Challenge

## Description
A **Harshad number** (also called a **Niven number**) is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits.

### Example 1:
```
Input: 18  
Calculation: 1 + 8 = 9  
18 is divisible by 9  
Output: true (18 is a Harshad number)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: 21  
Calculation: 2 + 1 = 3  
21 is divisible by 3  
Output: true (21 is a Harshad number)
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: 23  
Calculation: 2 + 3 = 5  
23 is not divisible by 5  
Output: false (23 is not a Harshad number)
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a Java function to determine if a number is a Harshad number.
2. Add test cases with different values.

## Constraints:
- The input number is a positive integer.
- Optimize your solution for large numbers.

Good luck! ðŸš€
