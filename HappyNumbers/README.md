# ðŸŽ¯ Happy Number Challenge

## Description
A number is considered **happy** if, by repeatedly replacing it with the sum of the squares of its digits, it eventually reaches 1. If it enters an infinite cycle, it is considered unhappy.

### Example:
```
Input: 19  
Process:
1Â² + 9Â² = 82  
8Â² + 2Â² = 68  
6Â² + 8Â² = 100  
1Â² + 0Â² + 0Â² = 1  
Output: true (it is a happy number)  
```

## Tasks:
1. Write a function in Java to determine if a number is happy.
2. Add test cases for different numbers.

## Constraints:
- The input number is a positive integer.
- Optimize your solution to avoid infinite loops.

Good luck! ðŸš€
