# 🚀 Daily Java Challenge

This repository is dedicated to improving my programming logic and reinforcing Java knowledge through daily exercise resolution. The idea is to maintain a consistent streak of learning and practice by uploading solutions to various problems every day.

## 📌 Objectives
- Improve programming logic and problem-solving skills.
- Reinforce basic and advanced Java concepts.
- Develop skills in algorithms and data structures.
- Build a solid foundation for large projects.
- Maintain a daily streak on GitHub.

## 🏆 Challenges and Exercises
Every day, a new exercise will be uploaded with its respective solution. The exercises may include:
- Algorithms and data structures.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Optimization and efficiency challenges.
- Development of small projects or modules.

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
/exercises
  /challenge_name
    - Description.md
    - Solution.java

Each exercise will have a folder with its description and corresponding solution.

## 💡 Contributions
This is a personal project, but if you have suggestions for interesting exercises or improvements to my code, they are more than welcome!

## 📅 Progress
My goal is to complete one exercise daily and document my progress here.
